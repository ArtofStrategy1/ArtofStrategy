# Notes for the website:

[Elijah] (08/17): 

- Created a backup for the html page used by the "[Light] Postgres_V4" n8n workflow.

- Created a backup for the html page used by the working version of supabase annotated with "supabase-w".

[Elijah] (08/19):

- Created another HTML page called `index-working-copy.html`, please do not remove this. This will only work with "DONT_USE Supabase_V1" n8n workflow.
