      <p>
        The unprecedented successes of Gulf wars of 1990 and 2003 have brought to the fore the notion that wars could be fought and won through an overwhelming superiority in science, systems and technology.
        Science and Art of Strategy argue that while science, system and principles are useful, warfare is a complex phenomenon that cannot be successfully waged and won through science and technology alone. As the principles of war were derived from a science and system perspective, this study addresses whether war could be indeed studied as a science or system with deterministic outcomes. It will argue that while science and technology will continue to change how warfare will be conducted, its nature will largely remain unchanged and its outcomes uncertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study essentially argues that war and strategy is a multi-dimensional phenomenon requiring a multi-disciplinary approach placing great demand on the intuitive judgment of the man in the loop. It concludes that the art of war will, therefore, prevail as the more important aspect of warfare that will continue to be emphasized.

      <h2 class="section-title">Science and Art of Strategy</h2>

      <p>
        Scientific and technological advances in platforms, weapon systems, electronic spectrum and space technologies today offer opportunities for unprecedented dominance in conventional warfare. So pervasive is the addiction to science, system and technology that some strategic thinkers and defence planners firmly believe that warfare could be systematically studied, reduced to certain immutable principles and won decisively.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the 21st century, the time has come where space-based technologies and remotely piloted vehicles can not only identify targets but also destroy them in near real-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Science and technology will not only ‘lift the fog of war’, but through decision support systems, even provide commanders with options to select the best course of action. The late Arthur K Cebrowski propounded that ‘Network-centric warfare enables a shift from attrition-style warfare to a much faster and more effective warfighting style characterized by the new concepts of the speed of command and self-synchronization.’
      </p>

      <p>
        John Boyd also contends that ‘if you can go through the Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA) Loop faster than your enemy, you’ll live and he’ll die’.
      </p>

      <p>
        This paper attempts to rationalize the extent to which war could be studied as a science or system and whether its outcomes could indeed be deterministic. This will be done by firstly reviewing the historical relationship between science and warfare. Having appreciated the significant contribution of science to the outcome of past wars, the study will then attempt to establish a common understanding of some of the characteristics of science and system and their related concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The study will then introduce the principles of war and the ideas of Antoine-Henri Jomini, J.F.C Fuller, John Boyd and John Warden to discuss the notion that there could indeed be certain schemas or patterns rooted to the science and system perspective that are immutable and decisive in winning wars.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having established that there are indeed certain aspect of warfare that could be systemized and studied, the study will then introduce the international world order and the nature and dimensions of war and strategy with the explicit aim of discussing the extent to which war could be studied as science and be deterministic and to the extent, it will continue to be in the realm of uncertainty requiring the intervention of the intuitive judgment of the human in the loop.
      </p>

      <p>
        The study will then conclude on whether science and system could indeed be the panacea for winning future conflicts and therefore be the focus of future defence planners or whether we should strive to adopt a more balanced approach of also accepting uncertainty and developing military leaders to adapt to these challenges.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Historical examples</h3>
      <p>
        History is replete with examples where science and technology have made the difference between victory and defeat. Archimedes, through his inventions, was able to hold off the Romans from the fort of Syracuse for three years. The invention of the six-foot yew longbow by England offered a significant competitive advantage over decades of warfare against the Scots and Welsh. The side that could best exploit and integrate inventions in the battlefield prevailed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Germany’s blitzkrieg operations integrating airpower, communications and tanks decisively defeated France during the Second World War. The invention and dropping of the hydrogen bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki also brought about the speedy and unconditional surrender of Japan. The more recent unprecedented battlefield successes of the Gulf wars of 1990 and 2003 have further brought to the fore the notion that wars could be fought and won through an overwhelming superiority in science and system.

      <h2 class="section-title">Science, System and the Scientific Method</h2>

      <p>
        The 17th and 18th Century Age of Enlightenment gave momentum to the notion that human reason, more than blind adherence to certain belief system and authority, could be used to build a better world. According to Ferguson, most scholars agree that ‘Enlightenment finds its touchstone in the primacy of reason, the assertion of the scientific method, concern for experience, a belief in progress or at least in the possibility of collective human freedom, and finally a general disregard for tradition or constituted authorities’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Galileo used the first telescope to discover that Earth was not the centre of all celestial movement, and his approach highlighted a balance between intuitive thought and empirical testing. The fundamental premise of science is that there is ultimately some order in the universe and therefore it could be analyzed and studied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hypothesis, theories and laws or principles govern science. Science essentially aims to discover the ‘truth’. A scientific law is a statement of fact that is accepted as true and universal. A scientific theory ‘is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based on proven hypothesis’.
      </p>

      <p>
        More recently, systems theory — originated by Ludwig von Bertalanffy — emphasizes that real systems are open and interacting with the environment and therefore continually evolving. Through concepts of emergence, hierarchy, communication and control, it ‘focuses on the arrangement of and relations between the parts which connect them into a whole’. Complexity theory adds insights into dealing with uncertainty in warfare.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ideas of complexity theory show how systems adapt to randomness and the external environment and ‘give us insights into dealing with uncertainty in warfare’. However, both system and complexity theories continue to rely on the basic premise that systems have certain ‘schema’ or patterns that are determinable. These patterns could, in turn, provide insights on how to manage the real world and by drawing a parallel on how to systematically win wars.
      </p>

      <p>
        The illustration of scientific enquiry suggests that it has its usefulness in better understanding and managing aspects of warfare, which are definitive. Indeed there are many aspects where scientific enquiry could be applied (e.g. Geography, weapons systems, etc) and resource management issues could be readily optimized through simulation and modelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inductive and deductive cycle of reasoning is very much grounded in scientific enquiry. The question, therefore, arises whether there could indeed be certain schema or patterns of war that could be systematically analyzed and where definitive methodologies could be devised to achieve success?

      <h2 class="section-title">Science, System and Principles of War</h2>

      <p>
        The modern concept of principles of war has been traced by Azar Gat to the writings of Monteccucoli in the 16th century. During the era of the enlightenment the ‘ideal of Newtonian science… gave rise to an ever-present yearning to infuse the study of war with the maximum mathematical precision and certainty possible’.
      </p>

      <p>
        While thinkers like De Saxe, Puseygur, Turpin, Maizeroy and Guibert advocated the development of the principles of war, they acknowledged that there were aspects of war and strategy that require the creativity and genius of commanders.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Jomini, Fuller, Boyd, and Warden</h3>
      <p>
        Antoine-Henri Jomini inspired by Napoleon’s achievements wrote that ‘there are a number of fundamental principles of war, which can not be deviated from without danger, and the application of them, on the contrary, has been nearly always crowned with success’.
      </p>

      <p>
        J.F.C. Fuller expounded the scientific method as a common-sense approach to know the ‘truth about the past, and how we can apply this truth to the conditions which surround us and which will probably exist during the next war’.
      </p>

      <p>
        John Boyd’s OODA loop aims to achieve strategic paralysis by being faster in observing, orienting, deciding and acting than the enemy. John Warden viewed the enemy as a system and aimed to target the will of the enemy by attacking at the centre of gravity of the five rings of the system.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">On the use of principles</h3>
      <p>
        The principles of war serve as broad guidelines or considerations to facilitate military planning. For example, the principle of mass — to overwhelm an opponent by applying maximum force at a decisive point and time — contains three variables: mass, decisive point and time. Mass does not necessarily mean greater numbers, but rather the effective force.
      </p>

      <p>
        Decisive point and time, on the other hand, are of an intuitive and subjective nature. Identifying the tipping point would require an intuitive assessment after considering all the ensuing circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consequently, while these so-called principles are useful considerations, they are by no means immutable. They serve as useful start points or checklists but should not be viewed as silver bullets that guarantee success. The specific situation must be studied carefully.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="international-system" class="section section-international">
      <h2 class="section-title">The International System and the Nature of War</h2>

      <p>
        The international stage comprises a vast collection of sovereign governments. The world stage is largely anarchic without a single legitimate government to enforce law and order. Nation-states have national interests which are safeguarded or advanced by policy instruments including economic, diplomatic and military power. War is one instrument for advancing national interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the policy level, countries formulate the grand strategy — the art and science of using economic, diplomatic and military force to achieve national objectives. At the military level, a military strategy is formulated to employ military force to fulfil national policy. At the operational level, operational strategy plans engagements in a theatre of operation. At the tactical level, tactics are the art and science of winning battles to fulfil operational objectives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Michael Howard suggests that war comprises four main dimensions: social, technological, logistical and operational. Colin Gray proposes more extensive dimensions including ethics, society, politics, people, command, economics and logistics, organization, military preparations, operations, technology, information and intelligence, adversary, friction chance and uncertainty; and time. These highlight war's complexity and interdisciplinarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are clearly aspects of warfare that are largely deterministic, such as weapon and platform characteristics, geography and resource management. These are essential knowledge areas that support planning and doctrine development.
      </p>

      <p>
        The key differentiating factor is whether the employment of equipment or platform is definitive (and therefore prescriptive) or whether it requires weighing numerous factors and exercising rational and intuitive judgment.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="art-of-war" class="section section-art">
      <h2 class="section-title">Art of War</h2>

      <p>
        Jomini acknowledges that ‘War in its ensemble is not a science, but an art’ and ‘Strategy, particularly may be regulated by fixed laws resembling those of positive science, but this is not true if war is viewed as a whole’. Clausewitz also advances that war is an extremely complex phenomenon that involves the clash of wills between dynamic human forces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clausewitz viewed the nature of war as a paradoxical trinity composed of primordial violence, hatred and enmity; the play of chance and probability; and the element of subordination to policy and reason. It is due to the dynamic interplay of these forces that war will remain a complex phenomenon with a great deal of uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clausewitz argued that a military genius is required who has ‘an intellect that, even in the darkest hour, retains some glimmerings of the inner light which leads to truth or coup d’oeil; the courage to follow this faint and the strength of character and mind to overcome or exploit friction, chance and uncertainty.’ Moltke highlights that ‘Strategy is a system of expedients’ and the doctrine of strategy does not go beyond rudimentary propositions of common sense; their value lies in their application to the particular case.
      </p>

      <p>
        While warfare has both an art and science of strategy dimension, it is contended that its nature fundamentally remains an art. Kant suggested there are three forms of knowledge: understanding, reason and judgment. Reflective judgment (intuitive creation) constitutes the art which will continue to make human endeavours dynamic and their outcomes perpetually uncertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        The art of war is the weighing of situation, the enemy, the complex integration and interaction of diverse systems or dimensions of war through ‘coup d’oeil’ or intuitive (reflective) judgment and thereby deriving plans that best fulfil political or military objectives.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="conclusion" class="section section-conclusion">
      <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        From the review, although the science and systems approach may provide great opportunities for winning future wars and should be pursued, it should not be at the expense of studying and preparing for the other important aspects of warfare. Warfare is ultimately a human endeavour; a holistic approach is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plans can be developed and guided by science, but they need augmentation with a good understanding of the nature of war being fought, leadership development and realism to respond to uncertainty and dynamism inherent in warfare.
      </p>

      <p>
        Andrew Krepinevich aptly summarizes that such innovations must be backed up by new operational and organizational concepts, competitive advantage is often short-lived and there is no guarantee of continued dominance.
      </p>

      <p>
        While principles of war embody historical wisdom and serve as operational considerations, they should not be seen as immutable laws. Separate principles might be needed at grand strategy, military strategy, operational and tactical levels and for different operation types. War, as a human endeavour, will retain uncertainty and friction so long as it involves human wills.
