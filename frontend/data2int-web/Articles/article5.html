    <h1>What is a Strategic Vision?</h1>
    <p>
        A strategic vision is a clear, compelling, and forward-looking statement that defines an organization’s long-term aspirations and desired future state. It provides a roadmap for where the organization wants to go and serves as a guiding star for strategic planning, decision-making, and organizational alignment. A well-crafted vision clarifies objectives, inspires employees, informs stakeholders, and helps differentiate the organization from competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike a mission, which focuses on the organization’s present purpose, a strategic vision is inherently future-oriented. It captures the organization’s dreams and long-term ambitions while remaining grounded in core values, organizational culture, and realistic possibilities. A compelling vision statement not only motivates internal stakeholders but also communicates credibility and purpose to external audiences, including customers, partners, and investors.
    </p>
