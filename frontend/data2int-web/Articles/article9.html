        <h1>Strategic Leadership</h1>
        <p>To better understand President Trump's strategic leadership, it is useful to reflect on some of the historical writings and ideas of Carl von Clausewitz and Niccolò Machiavelli, two great thinkers on political philosophy and strategy, as well as the leadership qualities of some of the greatest American presidents. In more recent times, we will also explore the insights of the founding leader of Singapore, the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was well known and respected for his strategic leadership. In a brief span of fifty years, he transformed Singapore from a small trading port to one of the most advanced countries in the world. As we will soon discover, good strategic leaders also have visionary strategic plans.</p>
        
        <h2>Leadership Research</h2>
        <p>A large part of my career involved researching on the nebulous subject of leadership. It started with looking at the styles of leaders in history, reviewing leadership theories and analysing the leadership models of the Singapore Armed Forces, the U.S. Army, and Canada. The research then delved deep into the categorization of leadership by types, styles and levels and involved a leadership evaluation system, like the 360-degree method pioneered by John C. Maxwell.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the in-depth research, it was almost impossible to identify any one theory that could consistently define and explain a concept or trait of leadership that could be applied to most situations. There were as many theories as there were leadership styles. Each environment had its own 'favorite' qualities or values. In addition to the countless theories, the lack of a consistent and overarching leadership theory could also be attributed to the fact that great leaders thrived with their characteristics and actions during a phenomenon happening at that particular, unique moment in time. Certain leaders, with certain qualities, were just at the right place and at the right time to address those specific concerns or needs of their followers.</p>
        
        <p>The 1930s saw the introduction of 'great man' theories that suggested that good leaders are essentially born to lead. The theory presented that leaders are born with certain qualities like charisma, confidence, intelligence and social skills that naturally make them good leaders, implying that leadership could not be learned. Then came the trait theories, that suggested that people could inherit certain traits like self-confidence and courage, which are shared by many great leaders.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, the contingency theories suggested that the environment determines the style of leadership best suited for a particular situation. Good leaders are expected to strike the right balance between the needs of the specific situation and to apply the appropriate leadership style accordingly. Situational theories suggest that a specific situation dictates whether an autocratic, democratic or collaborative leadership style should be adopted. Behavioral theories argue that it is the actions of the leaders rather than any innate qualities that determine the success of their leadership and therefore people can, in fact, learn to become good leaders. Transaction theories suggest that an ideal leader is one who takes into account the inputs of others. Some examples of transactional theories include participative leadership and management theories.</p>
        
        <p>Transformational leadership theories focus on the connection between the leaders and followers, where leaders motivate and inspire people by setting clear goals and expectations for achieving higher performance and providing support and recognition to bring out their full potential.</p>
        
        <p>Based on most of these theories, the Singapore and U.S Armed Forces leadership models strive to develop core leadership traits, styles and skills to churn out effective leaders. The U.S. Army's model in particular places emphasis on certain character values and attributes, as well as the development of critical skills and behaviors.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, the Singapore Armed Forces leadership framework<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> also places emphasis on values, competencies, styles and self-awareness and 14 skills including critical thinking, ethical reasoning, planning, decision-making, communications, teambuilding, and personal mastery.</p>
        
        <p>There are also many leadership assessment tools that inevitably advocate for or codify certain leadership qualities or styles that could help identify good leaders. Some of the more popular assessment tools include DiSC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Compliance), Myer Briggs, and 360.</p>
        
        <p>Having explored all the various theories, models and assessment tools, it became apparent to me that having a long list of qualities or styles to develop successful leaders would be of little use to organizations. In larger institutions, it was thought that the fundamental concept of leadership could ultimately be narrowed down to the level of trust followers place on their leaders. The challenge for junior leaders was how to earn the trust of their workers or followers. Unfortunately, the seemingly simple concept of trust proved inadequate, leading to further wide-ranging and diverse views on why people trust their leaders.</p>
        
        <p>My analysis ultimately led me to identify a small number of higher-order qualities consistently found in most successful leaders and that could encompass most of the critical abilities needed for success. From my research, I found, rather unsurprisingly, that the leadership qualities identified by Carl von Clausewitz continue to ring true and feature significantly in most situational models and research studies. These qualities are essentially the following: courage, determination, self-control, coup de'oeil and a mind that is inquisitive, comprehensive and calm.</p>
        
        <p>In the words of Clausewitz:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "War is the realm of danger; therefore courage is the soldier's first requirement"
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "Two qualities are indispensable: first, an intellect that, even in the darkest hour, retains some glimmerings of the inner light which leads to truth; and second, the courage to follow this faint light wherever it may lead."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "We repeat again: strength of character does not consist solely in having powerful feelings, but in maintaining one's balance in spite of them. Even with the violence of emotion, judgment and principle must still function like a ship's compass, which records the slightest variations however rough the sea."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "If the leader is filled with high ambition and if he pursues his aims with audacity and strength of will, he will reach them in spite of all obstacles."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "...as man under pressure tends to give in to physical and intellectual weakness, only great strength of will can lead to the objective."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            'If we then ask what sort of mind is likeliest to display the qualities of military genius, experience and observation will both tell us that it is the inquiring rather than the creative mind, the comprehensive rather than the specialized approach, the calm rather than the excitable head to which in war we would choose to entrust the fate of our brothers and our children, and the safety and honor of our country.'
        </blockquote>
        <p>Coup de oeil is the "quick recognition of a truth that the mind would ordinarily miss or would perceive only after long study and reflection"</p>
        <p>A significant takeaway is that unlike many leadership theories suggesting that leaders are born with the primary qualities, Clausewitz believed that leaders, and military genius in particular, could be developed through realistic training and experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Carl von Clausewitz</h2>
        <p>Carl von Clausewitz was a Prussian military theorist in the late 1700s who studied and wrote on war and strategy. He envisioned a strong strategic leader as one who was bold, courageous and determined, who possessed coup d'œil or the ability to understand a situation with a quick glance, and who has a calm and comprehensive disposition to make the right strategic decisions at an opportune time.</p>
        <p>Clausewitz advocated a swift and decisive strategy of attacking an opponent's strength or their center of gravity, with maximum force. "Center of gravity" here refers to attributes of the opponents which, when defeated, would seriously jeopardize their chances of winning. His ideas were used with great success by the Germans through their blitzkrieg tactics during the Second World War. This ideology continues to guides certain aspects of the strategic and operational planning of the U.S. Army and Air Force today.</p>
        
        <h2>Niccolò Machiavelli</h2>
        <p>Niccolò Machiavelli, a 15th-century Italian philosopher often referred to as the father of modern political science, advocated for a certain degree of political ruthlessness to govern conquered states or control human nature. The realities of political affairs and public life require that rulers be strong and willing to use coercive force to ensure compliance. According to him, one needs to have a flexible disposition in politics regarding good and evil approaches to resolving an issue based on the circumstances. He argued for politics to have its own set of rules. Machiavelli's ideas have helped shape the development of some modern political theories and the American Constitution as well.</p>
        <p>Machiavelli had a deep understanding of human nature. He viewed humans as trustworthy during prosperous times but understood that they could quickly become selfish and deceitful during difficult times. Humans may be loyal when they receive favors, but such goodwill is never absolute. They respond more consistently to fear than to love.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Love endures by a bond which men, being scoundrels, may break whenever it serves their advantage to do so; but fear is supported by the dread of pain, which is ever-present."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Machiavelli argued that for princes or political leaders to remain in power, they need to be ruthless enough to be feared and kind enough to not be hated. Both ruthlessness and kindness should be viewed as a means to an end and not in terms of their intrinsic moral values. The application must always be based on benefitting the state and staying in power. He advocated for political leaders to maintain the goodwill of the people and avoid being hated, to undertake great projects that will enhance their reputation, and to choose wise advisors while avoiding flatterers.</p>
        
        <h2>The American Republic</h2>
        <p>It is not surprising that the founders of the American republic were familiar with the Machiavellian school of thought. In the development of the American Constitution, Machiavelli's writings were included as references. The founding fathers designed the republic to carefully balance powers given to the executive, judicial, legislative branches, as well as to the people, taking into account the nature of self-interest in human beings and the possibility that the government could also abuse its powers or become corrupt.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Upon this, a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with."
            <br>– The Prince by Machiavelli
        </blockquote>
        <p>Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy, written in the early 15th century, was used to advise the need for civic virtue in a republic to ensure that the public space of all citizens was preserved even at the cost of personal interest.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "The Citizens in a Republic who attempt an enterprise either in favor of Liberty or in favor of Tyranny, ought to consider the condition of things, and judge the difficulty of the enterprise; for it is as difficult and dangerous to want to make a people free who want to live in servitude, as to want to make a people slave who want to live free."
            <br>– Discourses on Livy by Machiavelli
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>Abraham Lincoln</h2>
        <p>Abraham Lincoln is often considered one of the greatest presidents of the United States. Not only did he persevere through a violent and costly Civil War, but he also enacted the Emancipation Proclamation to abolish slavery, gave the Black population the right to serve in the Army and Navy of the Union, and successfully reunited the Union after the war. His approach towards reunification did not involve imposing the Emancipation Proclamation conditions or other retributions against the defeated Confederate States. Instead, he focused on prioritizing the reunification process. His now-famous Gettysburg Address accurately captured the spirit of the times where he dedicated the sacrifices during the war to the founding principles of liberty, equality for all and a "government of the people, by the people and for the people".</p>
        <p>It is difficult to appreciate the heavy burden that weighed on Lincoln when he took the decision to push ahead with a war against his fellow Americans in the South and which would eventually result in a total death toll of 620,000. The reasons often cited for the American Civil War are dissent over states versus federal rights, economic disparities, the abolition of slavery, the election of Abraham Lincoln as president and The Battle of Sumter. In a way, they are all linked. The differences in the economies of the Northern and Southern States were impacted differently by the abolition of slavery, federal versus states' rights and the election of Lincoln. It resulted in the secession of South Carolina and several other states, and consequently the Battle of Sumter.</p>
        <p>Lincoln today is most remembered for his honesty, humility, courage, justice, and grace. At the core of his belief was that all people deserved equal treatment and to stand firm for what is right.</p>
        
        <h2>Franklin D. Roosevelt</h2>
        <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt is yet another U.S. president who will always be remembered as one of the greatest U.S. presidents in modern times. As the longest-serving president from 1933 to 1945, he not only led the country out of the Great Depression but also successfully defeated the Axis powers during the Second World War. His other achievements include setting up the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Social Security System, both of which still exist today.</p>
        <p>The Second World War saw unprecedented levels of death and destruction. President Roosevelt faced the daunting task of motivating the American people to sacrifice their livelihoods to support the war effort while also shouldering the responsibility of mobilizing 11 million American soldiers for the cause. A total of 405,000 American soldiers lost their lives.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt is most remembered for his innate sense of confidence, willingness to explore every possible solution during the Great Depression, his persistence and perseverance, and a firm belief that everything would eventually work itself out.</p>
        
        <h2>Ronald Reagan</h2>
        <p>President Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood actor, is largely considered as the most influential president in United States' history. He is credited for his strong stance against the Soviet Union, ending the Cold War, introducing the Strategic Defense Initiative missile system, heading the largest peacetime economic boom and enforcing strict legislation against drug offenses. In 1984, Reagan won in 49 of the 50 states, a record 525 electoral college votes and 59% of the popular vote.</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan is known for his boldness and courage to go against conventional wisdom or the mood of his times. His presidency helped to revive the indomitable spirit of Americans through sheer toughness and determination. Even during his most trying times, he was able to bounce back with renewed optimism and could also be 'warmly ruthless' with anyone who got in his way.</p>
        
        <h2>Lee Kuan Yew</h2>
        <p>In modern times, political leaders and heads of states have sometimes needed to defend their reputation and policies ruthlessly. Singapore's founding Prime Minister, the late Lee Kuan Yew, often vigorously defended the government's reputation against false accusations by his political opponents or the media. His political opponents often lost against him and were made to pay substantial amounts in damages, which he then eventually donated to charity.</p>
        <p>Realizing the political and economic uncertainties of Singapore's early years, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew often pursued his strategic policies vigorously, without fear or favor. He spoke plainly and truthfully about the hard choices the country faced and often pushed through many of the politically sensitive policies such as the Sedition Act, Group Parliamentary Constituencies, Religious Harmony Act, abolishment of the Privy Council Appeal System, and the controversial public housing quota system. He was a strong advocate of the rule of law to protect the common public space of the citizens. He established the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau that had wide-ranging powers to prosecute at all levels of public and private service.</p>
        <p>His strong leadership, strategic vision, and determination paid off handsomely; today, Singapore is widely acknowledged as one of the most successful nations in the world. Singapore boasts the best primary and secondary education in the world; according to the 2020 QS World Universities ranking, two of its universities share the spot as top 11th schools globally. The nation also enjoys strategic national reserves of more than $300 billion and, in 2017, had the third-highest GDP per capita in the world. It has one of the most advanced armed forces in the region and is also ranked as the second least corrupt nation in the world.</p>
        <p>Lee Kuan Yew was not only a visionary, but also a very determined and demanding leader who was relentless in his pursuit of excellence. Following Singapore's separation from Malaysia, the country did not have many resources to work with. Lee pushed his team of ministers to continuously seek improvements, expecting a high quality of performance from each of them. He encouraged the adoption of some of the ideas and best practices used around the world to further advance the country. Those working under him inevitably felt a great degree of pressure, as he did not hesitate to remove anyone not meeting his high standards. Lee Kuan Yew had the rare ability to pick good leaders who were able to translate his strategic vision into operational plans. He played the more crucial role of bringing all the individual components together. Scholars from Singapore were sent to the top universities around the world and relayed their knowledge on operational efficiencies back to Singapore through direct communications with Prime Minister Lee. In this way, some of the best practices overseas were quickly injected into the establishment of Singapore's public service, resulting in an incredibly successful and high-functioning city-state.</p>
        
        <h2>Political & Strategic leadership</h2>
        <p>Having explored forward-looking thinkers and strategists, what are the exact qualities that make for great strategic leaders? Gleaning from their varied experiences and leadership styles, one can argue that a leader should be honest, trustworthy, bold and courageous, determined, decisive, have a visionary and comprehensive mind that is not easily perturbed or defeated, have coup d'oeil and a winning mindset.</p>
        <p>While political leaders should possess all the qualities expected of great strategic leaders, they also require a few additional qualities. To be able to win elections, they need to be excellent communicators and campaigners. They must be able to tap into the sentiments of the voters and carefully articulate their vision and policies to win over the trust and confidence of the people. They must not only be able to defeat their political opponents but also protect their own reputation and policies ruthlessly against unscrupulous attacks or smear campaigns. They must possess boundless energy, have the ability to respond to unexpected crises as well as the flexibility to negotiate with their opponents to either build consensus or achieve a compromise.</p>
        
        <h2>Strategic Planning</h2>
        <p>Good strategic leaders develop and implement good strategic plans. A review of the strategic planning literature at most business schools and the Kennedy School of Government, as well as the way in which it is taught, suggests that most public administrations and academic institutions lag behind many multinational corporations and the military in terms of rigor and sophistication in strategic planning.</p>
        <p>World-renowned Harvard professor Michael Porter's generic theory on cost or differentiation business strategies are scope limiting, while McGill professor Henry Mintzberg's emergent strategy is a caveat for lack of foresight or a more detailed analysis. While game theory is useful in selecting amongst various choices, it is not helpful in developing strategic options. Novel strategic plans often emerge after repeated iterations of the options from the generic to specific and then back to the generic.</p>
        <p>There are some institutions within the U.S. military that are well endowed in the mechanics of strategic planning. It is critical that the strategic elements of all the U.S. government agencies become informed by these military institutions so they may better develop and manage their own detailed and comprehensive strategic drawer plans. Appendix 2 shows some possible steps that could be used to implement better strategic planning in the U.S. government as a whole.</p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Good strategic leaders are trustworthy, courageous, determined, intuitive, comprehensive and decisive. In order to successfully govern, they need, at times, to be ruthless in defending their reputation and policies, and must be prepared to use coercive force when necessary.</p>

        <h2>THE STRATEGY, INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP NEXUS IN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SMEs)</h2>
        
        <div class="abstract">
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>The aim of this research is to elucidate an understanding of the relationship between firm performance and innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy among high-technology Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the biotechnology industry. The basic premise of the research is that there is a nexus between innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy and firm performance of SMEs in the biotechnology industry. It rests on the assumption that although innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy maybe have been widely studied as separate constructs, they are closely related and consequently also in terms of their contribution towards firm performance. By scrutinizing the similarities and differences between the innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy constructs and their respective impacts on firm performance, this study will highlight and distinguish their respective or consequent impact on firm performance. It maintains that it is through judicious management of the innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy that firms are able to achieve superior firm performance and sustainable competitive advantage. The study also suggests that having a well-defined strategy can synergize innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p>This study seeks to better understand the nexus between innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy constructs and their corresponding impact on firm performance. Based on the study of SMEs in the high-tech biotechnology, an SEM model is built with a dependent variable measuring firm performance, and independent variables of innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy represented by the New Product Development, entrepreneurial orientation and strategy constructs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Chapter 1 Introduction</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1. Background</h3>
        <p>The EU Green Paper defines innovation as 'the renewal and enlargement of the range of product and services and associated markets, the establishment of new methods of production, supply and distribution and the introduction of changes in management, work organization, and working conditions and skills of the workforce' (EC 1995)</p>
        <blockquote>
            'Innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurship by which entrepreneurs exploit change as an opportunity for a different business or service'
            <br>(Schumpeter, 1934)
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            'Improving quality is meaningless without knowing what kind of quality is relevant in competitive terms…Entrepreneurship unguided by strategic perspective is much more likely to fail than succeed'
            <br>(Porter, Economist 1987)
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            While innovation creates value and entrepreneurship harnesses value, it is strategy that will sustain that value
            <br>(Gurbachan Singh, 2009)
        </blockquote>
        <p>The various definitions serve to highlight the difficulties faced in to distinguishing between strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship and explain why they are largely studied separately. This study attempts to analyze the relationship between innovation entrepreneurship and through their impact on firm performance. The basic premise in the research is that innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy are essential for superior and sustainable firm performance and that there is close nexus between innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy. Having a better understanding of the relationship between innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy can help firms better align their internal processes. It is through aligning and exploiting the nexus between innovation. Entrepreneurial orientation and strategy that firms can achieve superior sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
        <p>There are enormous risks associated with the high technology industry. It is inevitable that governments and high technology industries tend to focus on the R&D effort to be the first to achieve the scientific breakthroughs and the corresponding patent protection. Frequently top managers in high technology firms are also heavily biased towards technical disciplines such as science and engineering, numerous reasons have been suggested as to why certain industries or high technology firms perform better than others. These reasons range from the local environment or 'clusters', management of technology, comparative and competitive advantage, internal capabilities of the firm, collaboration, government policies or simply market imperfections. Despite the increase in investment in innovation capacity, many regions are learning the expensive lesson that innovation is a necessary but insufficient condition for regional economic growth and that the 'commercializing activities of local entrepreneurs are necessary to convert a region's innovation assets into long-term economic gain' (SBA Office of Advocacy, 2005 #247). There is, however, the consensus that entrepreneurial orientation and innovation plays a crucial role in generating and sustaining the growth of an industry or firm. Besides having the necessary knowledge and innovation capacities and capabilities for new product development and patents, parallel efforts in the entrepreneurial orientation not only help to mitigate the risks but enhance the chances of creating and sustaining competitive advantages. This study argues that the success of high technology firms requires a balanced approach, where besides innovation capacity; emphasis must also be placed in entrepreneurial orientation. This dissertation, therefore, studies the nexus between entrepreneurial orientation and innovative intensity and their effects on success in high technology firms in Boston.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Research Aim and Objectives</h3>
        <p>Separately studies have shown that entrepreneurship, innovation and strategy are critical to achieving and sustaining competitive advantage. They are widely acknowledged as a major engine of economic growth. Porter highlights that innovation, continuous improvement and change are the three cornerstones of global competition and that 'innovation and entrepreneurship are at the heart of the national advantage'(Porter 1990). Entrepreneurial orientation drives decision-making and behavior toward creating new goods, new methods of production, new markets, or the new organization of an industry (Stevenson & Jarillo 1990). It is plausible to argue that there is a nexus between innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy and their consequent effect on firm performance.</p>
        <p>The overall aim of the present research is to gain an understanding of the relationship between firm performance and the innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy nexus among technology-oriented biotechnology firms in Boston. This study taps on a wide range of studies on innovation, entrepreneurship at strategy at the firm levels to gain insights on the high technology industries in Boston. The study will analyze and compare the causal relations between entrepreneurial orientation and innovation intensity on firm performance. Firstly, it will establish the various dimensions of the factors and empirically analyze their impact on firm performance. Secondly, case study analyses will then be carried out to identify any characteristics that may be unique to the selected high technology industry, and their corresponding impact and outcomes. Where possible the results of the survey and case studies will be compared with each other to explore if there is any convergent validity. To achieve the aim, the research is mindful that the study of innovation and entrepreneurship involves an understanding of complex relationships, inter and intra-organisational and interpersonal ones, within the context of firm performance.</p>
        <p>The study will specifically attempt to answer the following research questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What are the dimensions of innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy and to what extent do they contribute to the high-tech biotechnology firm performance?</li>
            <li>What evidence is there of a nexus between the innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy?</li>
            <li>Is there goodness of fit between innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy and firm performance?</li>
            <li>Is there an overall aligning dimension that in turn significantly affects the others?</li>
            <li>What evidence is there that the nexus brings about superior firm performance?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>1.3 Research Setting</h3>
        <p>The setting of the research is on the biotechnology firms within the context of the high-tech industries in Massachusetts. This section presents a background and the setting in which the present research is undertaken. The concepts of innovative intensity, entrepreneurial orientation and strategy and their implications for firm performance are presented. Since the research is conducted within the context of Massachusetts, a brief background is provided on its biotech industry.</p>
        
        <h4>1.3.1 Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Strategy</h4>
        <p>High technology industries are characterized by a great dependence on science and technology innovation that leads to new or improved products and services. They generally have a substantial economic impact, fueled both by large research and development spending, and a higher than industry average sales growth. For the purpose of this study, the biotechnology sector that is envisaged to have substantial economic impacts on Massachusetts's economy is selected.</p>
        <p>This study extends research on studies that explored the impact of innovation, entrepreneurial orientation and strategy on high technology industry and organizations. It examines the determinants of innovation in Porter's study on innovative capacities, Clayton Christensen's disruptive innovation, as well as several resource-based and new product development, approaches. The focus of this study is at firm levels. As noted, the industry of interest selected is high technology industries in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>To explore and measure the effects of innovative intensities at the firm level the study taps into prior research of Community Innovation Survey (Kleinknecht 1996; Crepon et al. 1998; Loof & Heshmati 2001; Mairesse & Mohnen 2001; Cooper & Kleinschmidt 1987; Johne & Snelson 1998) and the new product development studies (Cooper & Kleinschmidt 1987; (Montoya-Weiss & Calantone 1994); Johne & Snelson 1998;). Using data from the Community Innovation Survey of countries of the European Union studies have been able to analyze the causal relationship between innovation and firm performance. In addition, the studies have also suggested causal relationships between the general characteristics of firms, their environment and their innovative intensity. The new product development studies, besides complementing areas covered by the Community Innovation Survey studies, provide greater resolution of firm characteristics and the internal firm processes.</p>
        <p>To explore and measure the effect of entrepreneurial orientation at the firm level the study taps into prior research of Miller, 1983; Morris and Paul, 1987; Covin and Slevin, 1989; Davis, Morris and Allen, 1991, Lumpkin and Dess (1996) and Lumpkin (1998) that identified a set of five distinct dimensions: product/service innovativeness, a tendency to support creativity and experimentation in introducing new products/services; process innovativeness, a willingness to support novelty and technological research in developing new processes; risk-taking, a willingness to take bold actions with uncertain outcomes; proactiveness, a forward-looking perspective involving acting in anticipation of future demand or change; and competitive aggressiveness, a tendency to be forceful and combative in efforts to outperform industry rivals.</p>
        <p>To explore and measure the effect of strategy on firm performance the study will tap into prior research of on ……..</p>
        
        <h4>1.3.2 Massachusetts Biotechnology SMEs</h4>
        <p>There are over 400 biotechnology companies located in the state, of which 235 are developing therapeutic drugs. Roughly 42,917 biotechnology employees in Massachusetts are responsible for over $5 billion of in-state payroll. Biotech employment grew by 25.6 per cent between 2001 and 2005, adding over 8,000 jobs.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Massachusetts-based biopharmaceutical companies have already developed 50 large molecule drugs covering a range of illnesses, including areas such as cancer, infectious and neurological diseases. There are nearly 1,769 drugs being developed in Massachusetts, representing over 7 per cent of the global drug pipeline. Massachusetts is home to the top five National Institutes of Health-funded hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
        <p>Firm size may be associated with the extent to which the firm has the capacity to implement dedicated innovation and strategy initiatives. Large organizations may be more likely than small ones to have well-developed innovation and strategic management program and agencies. Thus, the firm size was, therefore, another control variable. The size was measured as the natural logarithm of the number of employees (e.g., Huselid, 1995; Koch & McGrath, 1996; Datta et al., 2005). The focus was also narrowed to the small and medium enterprises.</p>
        
        <h3>1.4 Relevance of Research</h3>
        <p>In terms of value creation, biotechnology has the potential to outperform other industries. This is good for innovators, good for countries, good for companies, and good for the people working for these companies. As countries have limited resources, they need to maximize the returns on every dollar spent. Establishing high technology enterprises is an expensive business. It requires extensive investments in basic research, specialized skills, and sophisticated research and production facilities. Maintaining such industries requires long-term investments. Governments and corporations have become active participants in the development of biotechnology industries. This raises a number of critical issues: How can countries determine an appropriate mix of strategies, factors and capabilities to support the growth of firms in such industries?</p>

        <h3>1.5 Methodology</h3>
        <p>Data for the study will be obtained through a face-to-face questionnaire survey. The population of interest will be the relevant staff of the biotech firms in Massachusetts. The questionnaire is adapted from various studies including entrepreneurial orientations, Community of Innovation Survey (CIS-III) and relevant constructs from the new product development studies.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2 Literature Review</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>The debate on what are the factors that affect the performance of an industry or a cluster of firms is far from over. Many governments have tried their best to provide the necessary support and a business environment to grow selected industries that would support the country's long-term economic growth, similar to the success of Silicon Valley. There have been mixed results and the jury is still out as to whether endogenous or exogenous factors play a greater role. While there is unlikely to be any resolution on whether matter and as it is likely to depend on the nature of the industry, it is becoming increasingly apparent that ultimately the sustainable model will be one is where the capabilities are intrinsic to the firm. The firms must have the capacity and capability to exploit or adapt to external factors.</p>
        <p>Another aspect that is often actively debated as to what extent is it the highest leadership or the collective capability of the management and employees that can influence firm performance. While charismatic strategic leadership is important and can play a critical role in the success of the firm, increasing the trend is to focus a broader collective capability approach in sustaining firm performance.</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Industry and Firm Performance – A Theoretical Review</h3>
        <p>According to Porter, globalization, technological change and comparable factor endowment have 'nullified, or reduced, the importance of certain factors of production that once loomed large'(Porter 1990). Besides factor costs, he notes that 'differences in national economic structures, values, culture, institutions, and histories contribute profoundly to competitive success'.</p>
        <p>More recently, several resource-based theories have emerged to suggest an endogenous explanation for a firm's performance. These suggest that elements within the firm help explain such performance. The concept of 'dynamic capabilities' has received much attention. It suggests that 'the competitive advantage of firms is seen as resting on distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining), shaped by the firm's specific assets positions (such as the firm's portfolio of difficult-to-trade knowledge assets and complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has adopted or inherited' (Teece et al. 1997). The endogenous approach suggests that wealth creation depends largely on honing technological, organizational, and managerial processes inside the firm. Christensen and Michael Overdorf suggest that any 'inabilities' to take advantage of opportunities may reside within the firms (Christensen & Overdorf 2000).</p>
        <p>Seminal efforts in the 1970s ((Cooper 1979); (Myer et al. 1969); (Rothwell et al. 1974) have been conducted to identify critical factors that influence new product(innovation) success. The SAPPHO Project by Rothwell et. al. compared 43 successful and failed endeavors in chemical and instrument companies and found 41 determinants, ranging from attention to market to senior leadership. A more recent investigation (Cooper & Kleinschmidt 1995) identified 48 drivers, such as research and development(R&D) budget and new product aimed at familiar markets, of which 26 drivers discriminated between solid and weak performers. Further refinements of the model in subsequent studies identified 13 drivers as listed in the model below(Cooper & Kleinschmidt 2000).</p>

    <p>Figure 1 : NPD Conceptual Model – (Cooper & Kleinschmidt 2000)</p>
</div>
        
        <p>The model postulates that new product success is determined by the competitive advantage of the new product, which in turn is affected by the innovation process (execution), the company internal environment and the marketplace opportunities(Cooper & Kleinschmidt 2000).</p>
        <p>A meta-analysis by Montoya-Weiss and Calantone (1994) parsimoniously grouped the numerous and varied factors in NPD studies as strategic/organizational, NPD process and market environment. Subin Im et al. (2003) postulated that strategic/organizational drivers affect new product development (NPD) process which in turn influences the new product performance. Deriving a focused group of constructs, namely customer orientation, cross-functional integration, NPD team proficiency, NPD initiation and implementation, they were able to demonstrate the relationship between new product development and performance for Korean and Japanese firms. The model developed is illustrated below.</p>

</div>
        
        <p>Khalil and Ezzat argue that 'proper management of technology is what creates wealth'. They advocate that 'for developing countries to avoid being marginalized, they must formulate strong public policy, and companies must improve the way they manage technology and innovation'(Khalil & Ezzat 2001). This approach emphasizes the importance of public policy in providing the necessary environment for growth and the need to strike an integrating balance between the economic, technology and trade systems. They add: 'Effectively managing both the macro aspects and the micro aspects of these three systems is essential for sustainable growth'(Khalil & Ezzat 2001).</p>
        <p>David Yoffie suggests that while comparative and competitive advantages are important for national and industry performance, the dynamics of the global and national environment must be fully understood. This includes factors like the 'structure of the global industry, level and style of government intervention, characteristics of leading firms and the inertia of history'(Yoffie 1993). Firms and governments must identify the nature of their competitiveness, be it comparative advantage, political, oligopolistic or regulated, and adapt to the shifting industry and political environments.</p>
        <p>The entrepreneurship literature suggests that a set of organizational attitudes and behaviors characterizes entrepreneurial firms (Miller 1983a); (Stevenson & Jarillo 1990); (Covin & Slevin 1991.); (Covin & Miles 1999);(Lumpkin & Dess 1996); (Lyon et al. 2000); (Lee et al. 2001). Historically, the literature pointed to innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness ((Miller 1983a); (Morris & Paul 1987); (Covin & Slevin 1989); (Davis et al. (1991)) Subsequently Lumpkin (1996) included the dimensions of product/service and process innovativeness. Entrepreneurial orientation drives decision-making and behavior toward creating new goods, new methods of production, new markets, or the new organization of an industry (Stevenson & Jarillo 1990). As Lumpkin and Dess (1996: 136) observe, "…new entry explains what entrepreneurship consists of, and entrepreneurial orientation describes how a new entry is undertaken." Entrepreneurial orientation can this be defined as a firm-level predisposition to engage in behaviors that lead to change in the organization or marketplace.</p>
        <p>There are several schools of thought for strategy. Strategic management literature suggests that having clearly articulated vision, mission, goals, objectives are critical to long term sustainability. It emphasizes the need to regularly evaluating where you are, where you want to go and how you are plan to get there. This approach involves constantly reviewing the external environment, adapting the internal environment and developing and maintaining competitive advantages. Other approaches to strategy include adopting winning strategies through either differentiation or cost leadership and more recently through operational excellence, product leadership and customer intimacy. Yet other approaches suggest the need to explore and develop 'value innovation' strategies beyond current market dynamics to sustain future growth. The present-day dynamic global business environment has created major disruptions to a few strategies and strategic issues sometimes arise from a moral and ethical perspective. Some schools of thought, therefore, suggest that Strategy should not be certain prescribed parameters but therefore a way of thinking, planning and implementing that continue to achieve and sustain competitive advantages.</p>
        <p>The literature suggests that industry or firm performance is dependent on a dynamic interplay between a diverse range of internal and external factors. Any studies on industry and the firm's success should, therefore, consider the effects of these factors. However, the common theme that runs through these theoretical frameworks is that firms must continue to adapt or innovate to sustain their competitive advantage. This underpins the importance of innovation for a country's development.</p>
        
        <h3>2.2 Entrepreneurial Orientation and Firm Success</h3>
        <p>Past research has suggested that there is no characteristic, predisposition, or set of traits at the individual entrepreneur level of analysis that consistently "predicts" entrepreneurial activity. Miller argued that an entrepreneurial firm "engages in product-market innovation, undertakes somewhat risky ventures and is first to come up with 'proactive' innovations, beating competitors to the punch"; suggesting the dimensions of innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness, respectively(Miller 1983b). Lumpkin and Dess(1998) proposed two additional dimensions critical to the entrepreneurial orientation concept: competitive aggressiveness and autonomy. Collectively, these five dimensions—innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, competitive aggressiveness, and autonomy—permeate the decision-making styles and practices of a firm's members. Entrepreneurial orientation provides a strategic framework for researching the practices, processes and organizational mindset of firms engaged in managing firms and/or pursuing new ventures ((Lyon et al. 2000).</p>
        <p>Autonomy refers to a willingness to act independently and be self-directed in the pursuit of goals (Lumpkin & Dess 1996). It is envisaged that employees with high autonomy tend to have the drive to carry projects through to completion without relying on the support or approval of management.</p>
        <p>Proactiveness refers to a forward-looking, opportunity-seeking perspective (Miller 1983a); (Venkataraman 1989). It suggests both vision and leadership in launching business ventures or developing new strategic initiatives since it implies an ability to anticipate changes in demand or other trends that indicate emerging opportunities. Risk-Taking refers to making decisions and acting under conditions of uncertainty ((Brockhaus 1980.).</p>
        <p>Competitive Aggressiveness refers to the intensity of a firm's efforts to compete with industry rivals (Lumpkin and Dess, 2001). It often involves a combative response or an offensive aimed at enhancing performance and/or improving market share (Venkatraman, 1989) with an overall objective of defending previous gains and maintaining a strong presence in the marketplace.</p>

    <p>Figure 3: Conceptual model of the entrepreneurial orientation-performance relationship(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996)</p>
</div>
        
        <p>Studies have found that several of these five components were significant predictors of sales growth and/or profitability. Proactiveness and risk-taking were significant predictors of average annual sales growth, while innovation, autonomy and aggressiveness were significant predictors of both net worth and changes in net worth. Several measures of sales growth strategy were also significant predictors of firm performance.</p>
        
        <h3>2.3 Innovation</h3>
        <p>The EU Green Paper defines innovation as 'the renewal and enlargement of the range of product and services and associated markets, the establishment of new methods of production, supply and distribution and the introduction of changes in management, work organization, and working conditions and skills of the workforce'(EC 1995).</p>
        <p>Innovative intensity at the firm level is defined as the demonstrated commitment of innovation inputs and throughputs. It can be measured by the commitment to research and development (R&D) expenditure, Science and Engineering(S&E) expertise, collaboration with research institutions or other firms and the organization and processes supporting innovation.</p>
        <p>The terms 'innovative ability', 'innovative capability', 'innovative competence' and 'absorptive capacity' are often used interchangeably and for the purpose of this study refers to innovative capacity. The concept of innovative capacity is the potential of a firm, region or nation to generate innovative output (Porter & Stern 2002).</p>
        <p>The phenomena of innovation can be described using the terms innovation inputs, processes (innovation throughputs) and products (innovation outputs). Innovation inputs refer to resources that support innovative activities (for example, research, training and skilled workers). Innovation throughput refers to activities that support the innovation process (for example collaboration). Innovation output refers to the outcome of new products as a result of the innovation inputs, throughputs and activities within the firm.</p>
        
        <h3>2.4 Innovative Intensity and Performance</h3>
        <p>Innovation varies considerably across countries. In the past, the primary indicators for innovativeness were the expenditure on R&D and the number of employees dedicated to R&D. It was presumed that R&D expenditure will give rise to new knowledge and in turn, lead to product innovation. Today, more sophisticated measures are used. Thus, Porter and Stern have built an innovation index called 'National innovation capacity' (Porter & Stern 2002). This measure combines factors derived from three major areas of research on innovation – ideas-driven endogenous growth theory (Romer, 1990), cluster-based theory (Porter, 1990) and the national system of innovation concept (Nelson, 1993). The index, based on macroeconomic and political variables, predicts the 'economy's potential to produce a stream of commercially relevant innovation' and explains differences in patenting rates among countries. Based on the 'ideas-driven endogenous growth' and 'national innovation system' models, Furman et al found that the stock of knowledge (GDP per capita or stock of patent), resources devoted to innovation (full-time S&E personal or R&D expenditures), political institutions or policies (IP, openness of market) are important determinants of innovation. Based on cluster theory, they found that private R&D funding, R&D performed by universities and the linkages between institutions and industrial clusters central variables also affect the capacity to innovate(Furman et al. 2002). Their study suggests that Singapore is ranked 13 according to the national capacity index. A limitation of the national capacity index is that it does not directly measure economic output. The innovation output is based on international patenting that may not be translated into a new product. A further limitation of the index is that it does not take into account the simultaneity effect of innovation inputs and throughputs.</p>
        <p>While the macro-level policies and institutions are essential for innovation, it is ultimately firms that introduce and commercialize innovations. Firms must develop an internal innovation capability to generate and develop novel ideas into innovative products or processes. It is the collective firms' innovation capability that will shape the overall country innovative performance. The introduction of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) by the European Union in 1993 greatly facilitated the studying of relationships between innovation and firm performance.</p>
        <p>Based on the new product development, (Subin Im et al. 2003) identified a limited but focused number of new product development factors to examine the success of new products or innovations. Customer orientation was determined as a sufficient representation of market orientation(Gatignon et al. 1997). The significance of cross-functional integration to NPD is well documented (Song et al. 2000). Montoya- Weiss and Calantone have established the relationship between NPD Team proficiency and new product outcomes(Montoya-Weiss & Calantone 1994). Studies by Troy et al and Zaltman et al, have achieved consensus on simplifying NPD process to initiation and implementation(Troy et al. 2001; Zaltman et al. 1973). The study was able to demonstrate significant relationships between these constructs and the success of new product development.</p>

        <p>Firm performance: Research on organizational performance varies as a function of the outcome variables. We can categorize the variety of outcome variables into two groups: finance outcome (return on investment (ROI), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), Tobin's q, sales, market share, productivity, etc.) and non-finance outcome variables (labor turnover, absence of employees, conflict, quality of product and/ or service, innovation, etc.).</p>
        
        <h3>2.5 Strategy</h3>
        <p>There are several schools of thought for strategy. Strategic management literature suggests that having clearly articulated vision, mission, goals, objectives are critical to long term sustainability.

        <h3>3.4 Summary of Research Model</h3>
        <p>The proposed framework for the testing of the various hypotheses will be based on the model in Figure 5. The model will attempt to analyse the effects of entrepreneurial orientation, innovation intensity and strategy on firm performance and includes constructs from entrepreneurial orientation studies, community innovation survey studies, new product development studies and strategic management studies. The literature review identified that the various approaches complemented each other. While the community innovation survey's strength lies in the aggregated dimensions (e.g. R&D, S&E personnel), the new product development approach provides better resolution on the internal processes of the firm (e.g., marketing, customer orientation and implementation process). The entrepreneurial orientation studies strengths lie in providing perspectives largely not addressed in the innovation studies.</p>
        <div class="figure">

    <p>Figure 5: Theoretical Framework and Research Model</p>
</div>
        <p>The study will test the relationship between, entrepreneurial, orientation, innovation intensity and firm performance. A two-part questionnaire survey will be administered to selected biotechnology companies located in Massachusetts. The survey will be administered in December 2008/January 2009</p>
        <p>The questionnaire survey will be accompanied by in-depth interviews of four selected high technology firm case studies. The case studies will seek qualitative insights on the impact of the internal processes of the firms. The control variable of these case studies will be the firm size and business type, that is, manufacturing or service.</p>
        
        <h4>3.3.1 Theoretical Assumptions or Limitations</h4>
        <p>TBA</p>
        <p>The main limitation of the study is its limited external validity. It is a single-country study and focuses on the high technology sector. Therefore the findings cannot be generalized to all industries or other countries.</p>
        
        <h4>3.3.2 Dimensions and Hypotheses</h4>
        <p>It can be posited that a firm's entrepreneurial orientation will affect its performance. Using the five measures – autonomy, innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking and competitive aggressiveness give rise to the following five testable hypotheses that will be applied to the high technology industry:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hypothesis 1: The greater the proportion of a firm's autonomy, the greater that firm's potential for success.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 2: The greater the degree of proactiveness of a firm, the greater the firm's potential for success.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 3: The greater the degree of risk-taking by the firm, the greater it's potential for success.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 4: The greater the degree of competitive aggressiveness of a firm, the greater that firm's potential for success.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 5: The greater the innovativeness of the firm, the greater the firm's potential for success.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It can be posited that a firm's innovation intensity through inputs and processes will affect its performance. Using the EU survey, innovation intensity can be operationalised using four measures – R&D expenditure, S&E personnel's, inter-firm collaboration and collaboration with research institutions. This gives rise to the following four testable hypotheses that will be applied to the biotechnology industry:</p>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>Hypothesis 6: The greater the proportion of a firm's total expenditure on R&D, the greater that firm's performance.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 7: The greater the proportion of Science and Engineering personnel employed by a firm, the greater that firm's performance.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 8: The greater the degree of collaborative intensity between firms, the greater the performance of those collaborating firms.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 9: The greater the degree of collaborative intensity with universities/research institutions by a firm, the greater that firm's performance.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A major purpose of this study is the way in which industry performance of firms, with different internal characteristics and processes, varies according to the innovation intensity in those firms. Hypotheses 6 to 9 are based on constructs from the new product development literature.</p>

        <h3>4.4 Research Approach</h3>
        <p>TBA</p>
        
        <h3>4.5 Population of Interest</h3>
        <p>The populations of interest are biotechnology companies residing in Massachusetts. The four case studies companies will be selected based on their successful track record in new product development, industry market share, performance in the past three years and size. Two of the companies will be biotechnology manufacturers while the other two will be in the biotechnology service industry.</p>
        
        <h3>4.6 Research Design</h3>
        <p>For the firm-level analysis, a questionnaire survey with relevant constructs from the entrepreneurial orientation, EU Community Innovation Survey-III (CIS-III) and new product development literature will be used to measure the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, innovation and firm performance.</p>
        <p>The relevant constructs from the entrepreneurial orientation seek to identify the perceived effects of autonomy, proactiveness, competitive aggressiveness, risk-taking and innovativeness on firm performance</p>
        <p>The relevant constructs from the Community Innovation Survey seek to identify the overall demographics of the high technology industry. It includes R&D personnel; R&D expenditures; sources of information; technology transfer and acquisition; technical cooperation; government support and perception of factors promoting or hindering innovation. A sampling of the potential measures and their characteristics is attached at Appendix A</p>

        <p>The new product development portion of the survey will explore the impact of customer orientation, NPD cross-functional integration, NPD team proficiency on NPD initiation and NPD implementation. In turn, the impact of NPD initiation and implementation of new product performance will be determined. A sample of the measures is in Appendix B.</p>
        <p>To test the various hypotheses, the study will use the structural equation modelling method and case studies analysis. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is the primary method used to analyze the data and to estimate the significance and strength of the relationships between the different elements in the model. Using Amos 5.0 (Arbuckle, 2003, Arbuckle and Wothke, 1999) or LISREL, the study will follow the two-step analysis procedure recommended by Anderson and Gerbing (1988). In the first step, we validate the measurement models for each individual latent construct using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In the second step, we estimate the complete structural model. For both the CFA and SEM analyses, the goodness-of-fit parameters to be reported (RMSEA, SRMR, GFI, AGFI, NNFI, NFI, CFI, Delta2, and normed chi-square) reflect current standard practices in structural equation modelling (Hair et al., 1998, Hu and Bentler, 1998, Hu and Bentler, 1999, Kline, 1998, MacCallum and Austin, 2000, Schumacker and Lomax, 1996, Shook et al., 2004).</p>
        <p>The method of analyzing the case studies is in line with the 'pattern matching' method suggested by (Campbell 1975) and (Yin 1994), where information from the four case studies shall be matched with prior assumptions. In the context of the proposed study, the assumption is that innovation intensity in the high technology firms will positively impact on firm performance.</p>
        <p>Based on the data collected the firm characteristics and performance in the biotechnology industry will be analyzed.</p>
