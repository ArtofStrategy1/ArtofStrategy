| NS-001 | three_horizons      | True                |               5 | The LLM output perfectly aligns with both the user's prompt and the ground truth. It correctly identifies the main goal as acting on research findings and explicitly links Horizon 1 initiatives to 'integration support' and 'data security' while addressing scalability.                                                                      |
| NS-002 | living_system       | True                |               5 | The LLM output accurately identifies the inter-departmental communication failure as a primary weakness and proposes concrete, actionable interventions like regular meetings and project management tools, directly aligning with the ground truth's criteria. It also provides a comprehensive diagnosis that exceeds the minimum requirements. |
| NS-003 | creative_dissonance | False               |               3 | The LLM accurately identified dissonance points and conducted a relevant gap analysis. However, the strategic initiatives proposed were too generic and lacked the concreteness, such as leveraging the existing curriculum for new revenue streams (e.g., corporate training), explicitly requested in the ground truth.                         |
| NS-004 | thinking_system     | True                |               5 | The LLM output effectively deconstructs the user's prompt by identifying various 'rungs of the ladder' and then provides excellent 'new observations' and actionable 'new actions' that align perfectly with the ground truth's criteria for investigating root causes and conducting reviews.                                                    |
| NS-005 | all_frameworks      | True                |               5 | The LLM output is a complete JSON with all 7 required parts. The synthesis section effectively identifies the core themes and integrates insights from the other six analyses, directly addressing the conflict between the strong community and weak digital presence as specified in the ground truth.                                          |
