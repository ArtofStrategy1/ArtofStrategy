| ST-001 | process_mapping | True                |               5 | The LLM perfectly identified the key bottlenecks (manual account creation and lack of automated notification) directly from the prompt. It also proposed highly relevant and accurate optimizations that align precisely with the ground truth summary's expectations.                                                                                                           |
| ST-002 | pareto_fishbone | True                |               2 | The LLM partially categorized root causes correctly in the fishbone but critically missed 'potential memory leaks' under Methods. More significantly, its Pareto analysis failed to identify 'technical debt (memory leaks)' and 'infrastructure issues (QA environment)' as the 'vital few' as explicitly required by the ground truth summary.                                 |
| ST-003 | system_thinking | True                |               3 | The LLM correctly identified the 'Limits to Growth' archetype, which is a key part of the ground truth. However, its 'feedback_loops' and 'causal_links' sections failed to accurately represent the reinforcing and balancing loops as closed systems, instead presenting them as linear chains and missing some critical connections described in the prompt and ground truth. |
| ST-004 | leverage_points | True                |               5 | The LLM output perfectly matched the requirement for an empty 'feedback_loops' array. It also correctly identified the 'NexaScore AI engine' as a leverage point and provided an excellent rationale highlighting its proprietary and competitive advantage, as stipulated in the ground truth.                                                                                  |
| ST-005 | system_actions  | True                |               2 | The LLM correctly identified the short-term fix (manual reboot) and long-term solution (auto-scaling) with appropriate rationales. However, it failed to identify the 'Shifting the Burden' archetype as specified by the ground truth, instead classifying it as 'Limits to Growth', which is a significant error given the specific archetypal analysis requested.             |
