|:-------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SP-001 | mission_vision         | True                |               5 | The LLM output perfectly identified all key components from the user prompt, including mission, vision, values, and the specific goal with its KPIs and initiatives, aligning completely with the ground truth summary's requirements. The structured format and additional breakdown information enhance its quality.    |
| SP-002 | factor_analysis        | True                |               5 | The LLM successfully identified all strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats from the prompt. It then generated a comprehensive analysis object for each factor, including facts, deductions, and conclusions, as specified by the ground truth.                                                                 |
| SP-003 | goals_initiatives_ogsm | True                |               5 | The LLM accurately identified the main objective and all three core goals directly from the user prompt. It then provided logical and relevant strategies and measures for each goal, fulfilling the requirements of the ground truth summary effectively.                                                                |
| SP-004 | smart_objectives       | True                |               3 | The LLM correctly identified the main goal, extracted key actions, and inferred relevant risks. However, it failed to produce a single primary S.M.A.R.T. objective as requested, instead creating multiple sub-objectives with an incorrect time-bound element from the source material.                                 |
| SP-005 | action_plan            | True                |               5 | The LLM accurately extracted all key action items, assigned the correct owner, and inferred realistic timelines and priorities, satisfying all aspects of the ground truth. It also added valuable details like dependencies and KPIs, demonstrating excellent understanding of project planning.                         |
| SP-006 | kpi_research_plan      | True                |               5 | The LLM output perfectly identified the main goal, created the specified KPI groups with correct indicators, and generated relevant formulas for each. It met all requirements outlined in the ground truth summary accurately and comprehensively, while also providing additional valuable information from the prompt. |
