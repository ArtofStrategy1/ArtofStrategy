Sales Revenue Prediction Analysis

We want to understand the key drivers of our sales revenue to optimize our marketing budget and pricing strategy. 

Key Questions:
1. Which factors most strongly predict sales revenue?
2. What's the optimal marketing spend level for ROI?
3. How does pricing affect revenue across regions?
4. Are there regional differences in sales patterns?

This analysis will inform our Q2 marketing budget allocation.
