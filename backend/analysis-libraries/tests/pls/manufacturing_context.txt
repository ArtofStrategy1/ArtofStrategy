PLS Analysis for Chemical Manufacturing Process Optimization

We are analyzing the relationship between process parameters and product yield 
in our chemical manufacturing process. The goal is to identify which process 
variables most strongly influence yield and understand their combined effects.

Process Variables:
- Temperature: Reaction temperature (°C)
- Pressure: System pressure (bar)  
- Catalyst concentration: Active catalyst percentage
- pH level: Solution pH
- Reaction time: Process duration (minutes)
- Moisture: Environmental moisture content

Target Variable:
- Yield: Product yield percentage

Business Objectives:
1. Identify key process drivers for yield optimization
2. Understand variable interactions and latent factors
3. Develop predictive model for process control
4. Reduce process variability and improve efficiency

This analysis will inform our process control strategy and help optimize 
manufacturing parameters for maximum yield.
