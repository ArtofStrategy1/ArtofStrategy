We are analyzing sales revenue prediction for our e-commerce platform.
The goal is to understand how marketing spend, product pricing, and customer ratings
impact sales revenue across different regions.

Key business questions:
1. Which factors most strongly predict sales revenue?
2. Is there a optimal marketing spend level for ROI?
3. How does pricing strategy affect revenue?
4. Are there regional differences in sales patterns?

This analysis will inform our Q2 marketing budget allocation and pricing strategy.
